GOTCHA! 

You thought it would be this easy? In any normal circumstance, you could use the cat command, as it spits out the text inside a file (such as the text in this file), 
but we have encrypted the file through the Vim Editor, in order to protect its contents.

You will have to Vim-Decrypt this file in order for the file "secretfiles.py" to work.
The file "secretfiles.py" is a file that imports the contents from usernameandpassword1.py in order for it to function properly. 
You can see it for yourself, if you press 



  
In the Command Prompt window, type the following command "vim usernameandpassword1.py", once you do, Command Prompt will take you to the Vim Editor, 
where you are asked the Encryption Key for the file. 

CLUE 1: The Encryption Key is: "bashbash1"

If you enter this encryption key wrong, the contents of the files will be encrypted in gibberish, such as: 

x54a7h{HR<lmEh^)|k:0;f(vYr%1.[r2@iW|"Ys^E]lhwr?o`*0NE95c7=lmpjYEo<!U0<0]A-gr_MoI:BHVt@Q/889m$"MH'W~,,|otON-Rrc@vbm+s!TA_M)(si'

Make sure you enter the correct Encryption Key
